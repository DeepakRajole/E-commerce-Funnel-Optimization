# E-commerce-Funnel-Optimization
Ecommerce Funnel Analysis Project
Overview
For this project, I focused on analyzing the conversion funnel of an online store using data from Google Analytics 4. The goal was to understand how users interact with the site and identify areas where we can improve user experience to increase conversions.

Objectives
I wanted to analyze the different stages of the funnel, from the start of a user session to purchase. My aim was to pinpoint where users drop off and determine possible reasons for abandonment.

Insights and Findings
Ecommerce Funnel
The ecommerce funnel visualizes the stages of the customer journey, highlighting where users drop off before completing a purchase. This analysis helped me identify critical areas for improvement in the conversion process.

Conversion Metrics by Month/Date
I created a table that displays the number of purchases and user sessions broken down by month and date. This allowed me to identify trends and fluctuations in user activity and purchasing behavior over time.

Purchase Count by Landing Page Location
Another important aspect I analyzed was the effectiveness of different landing pages in driving purchases. The table provides insights into which landing page locations resulted in the highest number of conversions, helping me prioritize improvements to underperforming pages.

Identified Issues and Focus Areas
User Interface Design
One of the main issues I found was with the website's design. It needed to be more user-friendly and engaging to keep visitors interested right from the start.

Performance Optimization
I noticed that the site was quite slow, especially on mobile devices. Slow load times can frustrate users and lead to them leaving the site early.

Product Pages Enhancement
The product pages also needed improvement. They lacked sufficient product images and information, which may have deterred potential customers from making a purchase.

Registration Process
The registration process was a bit cumbersome. I felt that simplifying it could reduce friction and encourage more users to complete their purchases.

Next Steps
Data Collection: I plan to continue gathering data from Google Analytics to further refine my analysis and insights.

Implementation: My next steps involve implementing design improvements, optimizing site performance, and streamlining the registration process based on the issues I identified.

Testing and Iteration: I'll conduct A/B testing and iterate on these improvements to ensure they have a positive impact on user engagement and conversion rates.

Conclusion
This project has been a great learning experience in applying data-driven insights to optimize an ecommerce funnel. By addressing the issues I identified and focusing on enhancing user experience, I hope to contribute to better overall performance and customer satisfaction on the site
